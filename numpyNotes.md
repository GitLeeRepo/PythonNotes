# Overview

Notes on the numpy package

# Install Windows (including Anaconda install info)

I initially installed [Pyzo](http://www.pyzo.org/), and per its recommendation I installed **Anaconda** (**Miniconda for Windows (64-bit)**, because it makes it easier to install scientific packages.  After doing so I now have two Python interpreters on my Windows 10 system, neither of which is on the environment path.  With **Anaconda** this wasn't to much of an issue since it has its own **Andaconda Prompt** utility that runs Python without being on the path.  But **VSCode** could not find it so I ended up adding it to the path anyway.

Anaconda's Getting Started document shows it also installed with the Anaconda Navigator, which I did not have.  I found this could be installed from within the **Anaconda Prompt** as follows:

```
conda install anaconda-navigator
````

To get **numpy** installed I ran the following from the **Pyzo shell**:

```
install numpy
```

I then tested it in a Python script with the following **import command**:

```python
import numpy as np
```

# Install Linux
